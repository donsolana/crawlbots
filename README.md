# Crawl Bots
A collection of scrappers I build.

### 1. Hotels_lag.py
This program is designed to scrape a hotels website for hotels in Lagos, Nigeria. 

#### **Tools**
It uses the Python library ***Scrapy***, together with ***xpath*** and ***css-locators*** to navigate HTML of the pages in the website and extract infomation.

#### **Features**
1. It scrolls through 30 pages and extracts 340 entries.
2. It converts to a csv format that can be easily read by a spreadsheet software or the human eye.
